# üè• Healthcare Microservices Platform

A demonstration project based on microservices architecture for managing patients, billing, and analytics within a healthcare system. The system is composed of several collaborating services: `patient-service`, `billing-service`, `analytics-service`, `auth-service`, and an `api-gateway`.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Spring Security (JWT)**
- **Spring Validation**
- **gRPC**
- **Apache Kafka**
- **PostgreSQL** (per service)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**

### Communication
- **gRPC** ‚Äì Synchronous service-to-service communication (`patient-service` ‚Üî `billing-service`)
- **Kafka** ‚Äì Asynchronous/event-driven messaging (`patient-service` ‚Üí `analytics-service`)

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token-Based Authentication**
- **Auth Service** as central authentication microservice
- **API Gateway** with JWT verification and request filtering

### Documentation
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI**
- Exposed via **API Gateway**

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker / Docker Compose**
- **AWS LocalStack (for local testing)**
- **AWS CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code)**
- **ECS, VPC, MSK, RDS, Application Load Balancer**

## üß± Microservice Overview

- `patient-service` ‚Äì Patient CRUD, data validation, gRPC client, Kafka producer
- `billing-service` ‚Äì Billing management, gRPC server
- `analytics-service` ‚Äì Kafka consumer for patient-related events
- `auth-service` ‚Äì User management and authentication (JWT, Spring Security)
- `api-gateway` ‚Äì Entry point for external requests with routing, security, and documentation

## üß™ Testing

- Unit and integration testing for controllers and services
- Token validation and secured endpoint testing

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure (CloudFormation IaC)

- Creates:
  - VPC
  - Databases (RDS)
  - Kafka cluster (MSK)
  - ECS clusters and services
  - Load balancer (ALB)
- Docker images deployed to LocalStack or AWS
